### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

M.Sc.Eng. Student at Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile.
I've been researching for this institution's artificial intelligence laboratory for over 2 years, with emphasis in Machine Reasoning, Meta Learning and Adaptive Computation Time models.
Teaching assistant for the courses Artificial intelligence, Deep Learning, and the Capstone for Software Engineering majors, as well as teacher in the same institution's AI diploma course.
Passionate about the outdoors (ultra-running, skiing, hiking, etc!) and scientific innovation.

I'll be joining Stanford University as a Ph.D. student Fall 2021.
